# react-native-fancy-label
Cross platform (eventually) class for styling text with gradients, strokes, inner/outer shadows with blurring, as well as fading.

Currently this is just a wrapper on [THLabel](https://github.com/MuscleRumble/THLabel) for iOS, with some slight modifications for auto-shrinking font size.  Check there for more information. 

The included example shows usage of every single value possible currently. 
Note: Currently this is only single line, width must be specified manually, and text value must be passed as a prop.
